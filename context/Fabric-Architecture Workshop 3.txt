Meeting notes:
Subscription Configuration: Participant_D and Participant_P discussed the configuration of the subscription, focusing on the Acme-Sub OT Data Dev EA resource group. They reviewed the subscription details and the associated resource groups, ensuring that the setup aligns with their requirements.
Resource Groups and Networking: Participant_D, Participant_P, and Participant_C reviewed the resource groups within the subscription, including the network watcher and IoT data groups. They discussed the organization of these groups and the networking setup, including private endpoints and VNet configurations.
Access Governance: Participant_D and Participant_P discussed how access is governed at the subscription level, including the use of guest accounts for ACME resources. They also talked about the roles and permissions assigned to different groups and individuals.
MQTT Broker and Security: Participant_C and Participant_P discussed the MQTT broker hosted on a VM, including access control and potential security concerns. They considered the need for scaling and the importance of securing the broker to prevent unauthorized access.
.
Team Structure and Roles: Participant_C and Participant_P discussed the team structure, noting that the small team of three members handles various roles, including data engineering, data science, and Power BI report development. They also considered the need for defining specific roles and permissions for different tasks.
Fabric Configuration and Administration: Participant_D and Participant_P discussed the configuration and administration of the Fabric capacity, including the management of tenant-level administrative roles and workspace-level authorizations. They reviewed the use of Power BI workspaces and the access control for internal users.
on-premises Connectivity and Networking: Participant_D and Participant_F discussed the connectivity between the cloud and on-premises environments, including the use of VPN and VNet peering. They reviewed the network design and the role of firewalls in managing traffic between the environments.
Data Integration and Security: Participant_D, Participant_C, and Participant_P discussed the integration of external services like CloudDB_A and CloudProviderB, including the use of credentials and the security of data transfers. They also reviewed the process of data extraction and the role of ModelQ in managing the data.
Model Deployment and Data Flow: Participant_D, Participant_C, and Participant_P discussed the deployment of ML models by ModelQ and the data flow between the on-premises environment and the cloud. They reviewed the options for hosting the models and the communication between the MQTT broker and the ML models.
.
Next Steps and Recommendations: Participant_D summarized the next steps, including the development of reference architectures and diagrams to evaluate security. He mentioned the need for further discussions with the security team and the importance of logging and monitoring in the overall setup.
Are these notes useful?

ACME Fabric-Architecture Workshop Meeting Recording

Participant_C started transcription

Participant_D   0:03
Just validate them. So really the question I have right now is just going over this to make sure the specific configuration is is is accurate on the resources and then it allows us to kind of identify you know potential gaps or blind spots.
You know that I could have a discussion with security, right. There is a, you know, there's also the flow, the data flow diagram, which I mentioned Participant_A is working on. He came up with a draft where we're reviewing it internally. So those are things in process that would be part.
Part of the the output of the engagement, right? So with that said, I guess the starting point would be, you know, logging into Azure, the subscription.
The subscription and I think you know based on my notes, it's the Acme-Sub OT Data Dev EA resource group right where we could start off.

   1:01
Mhm.

Participant_P   1:03
Yeah, perfect. I'm just activating my roles.

Participant_D   1:05
OK.
No worries. And then if you could share the screen, um, I'm just gonna be working off my notes here.
See. Let me get in a comfortable position.

Participant_P   1:30
Ready.

Participant_D   1:34
Subscription.

Participant_P   1:38
So so we can start here at a horn OT data dev EA.

Participant_D   1:38
So this.
Give me one second, so.
This subscription is under I see Acme-Sub.
S.
See. Could you right right click on the right side on your name? I just wanna see what the what tenant this is affiliated with.
It's. I don't want LLC. OK, well, I'll get it later. I'll go to switch directories. I just wanna see like the the actual like cloud name.
It's like a on microsoft.com or something like that.

Participant_P   2:19
Switch directories.
This.

Participant_D   2:24
Yeah. OK. So there. OK, OK, so this is the current. OK, give me one second.
Yeah.
OK, cool. Yeah, you go back to where you're at and then the subscriptions that we are, the subscriptions that we that are we're we're of concerned of is.
The.
Acme-Sub NOT Data Dev EA, right?

Participant_P   3:10
Yeah, this is our.

Participant_D   3:12
Is that the only subscription that that is that the only subscription? Is this is this subscription where the primary like the primary workloads are or do you guys have like a dev non prod?
Production subscription that that you use to promote configurations through.

Participant_P   3:32
Yeah, so.
We do have another one. There's nothing in there, but it's basically the same Acme-Sub OT Data Prod EA and we're currently working with the networking team to have them put the.
Was that called their security policies in place so that we can start working on it? But there was some overlap between this workshops with you guys and them, so we haven't done much there, but the majority of the work has been in depth for now.

Participant_D   4:10
OK.
OK.

Participant_P   4:15
And then once we know the ideal architecture, we can build upon that.

Participant_D   4:21
OK, OK, perfect. And then within the subscription, can you go down, go to resources? I know they had a couple of resource groups. Is that how you're kind of organizing? And this subscription is dedicated, right? So I'm, I'm, I'm assuming this is a dedicated subscription for you guys.
Just for this specific workload, where I'm getting at is, you know, we have there's different reference architectures for cloud adoption framework. There's a sub, you know, there's a shared subscription like shared architecture and then there's like you know.
Sometimes we'll have, you know, purpose-built subscriptions for various groups in an organization like identity, networking, et cetera. And then you have your workloads. Is that kind of, you know?
This subscription, this is the only ones that you know. This is where the the entire yield solution is gonna be built in, right?

Participant_P   5:21
Mm yeah.

Participant_D   5:21
Right now it's an assumption, right for me.

Participant_P   5:25
Yeah, I so this is the resource group and then or so these are the resource groups associated with that subscription. You have a network watcher RG network OT data dev and IoT data is where kind of like the BI team has been building.
The stuff and then the the rest is more for the network people. I don't claim to know what it is exactly, but we can pick in there.

Participant_D   5:53
Yeah, yeah, no worries.

Participant_C   5:55
No, the the the see the network watcher is the built-in one, the network, the other one, the RG network, that's probably your internal network connectivity. Yeah, there could be a Vnet and subnets in there. Yeah, I see two private endpoints in there and there is a Vnet. Yep.

Participant_D   5:56
OK.
Yeah.

Participant_C   6:13
That's what it is.
The first one, don't worry about that, that gets created automatically.

Participant_D   6:20
Yeah. And then, um.

Participant_P   6:21
Oh.

Participant_D   6:25
I'm taking my notes, OK? And IoT is where the VM sits, right?

Participant_P   6:33
Yep, that's where the BM, the ADLS and the fabric capacity are.

Participant_D   6:38
OK.
So I'm gonna let my check box going to OK at the subscription level how is how is access governed like this is so this is I know they mentioned that the ACME folks have they're using.
Crossing in sync to get their identities over. Like let's say for example the networking folks it is the networking folks. Are they ACME resources or Acme-Sub like you know?

Participant_P   7:19
Yeah, they're they're ACME. From what I understand, Participant_J was here, but he left. But from what I understand, they're they're guest accounts and they've they are given.

Participant_D   7:23
OK.
OK, perfect.

Participant_P   7:35
Either some sort of role or group.

Participant_B   7:36
Yep.

Participant_E   7:38
Yeah, there's CSA as well.

Participant_D   7:39
OK, Bill.

Participant_E   7:42
Into this from their guest accounts.

Participant_D   7:42
OK, perfect.
OK, perfect.
And this is a kind of a pattern that they they've come up with, right? Like kind of the authorization pattern, I'm assuming.

Participant_P   8:02
M.

Participant_D   8:02
OK, perfect CSA.

Participant_C   8:06
I I also see the Hive MQ appliance there looks like to me that's for the MQT, right? Is that what it is?

Participant_P   8:14
Yeah, this is the VM that hosts the MQTT broker.

Participant_C   8:17
OK.
OK. And who else like you know, so I I see that you have given access, but what can they do? Can they control the VM? Because I look, it looked like it has contributor access and owner access when I was looking at the IM.
There should be a concern for everyone putting their hands in that, you know.
And is the also the plan is to add like the MQTT you know the scale set or it's going to be a individual single server because that's a single point of failure right there.
Sorry, it's Participant_D. Just not trying to take. Yeah, yeah.

Participant_D   8:59
No, no, go for it. Yeah, yeah. No, no, go for it. You're leading right where I'm going. Like into. No, no, no, go for it. Go for it. Yeah, this is good because I I'm documenting too.

Participant_C   9:03
I'm sorry, go ahead. I'll just.
Yep, Yep, Yep. So Idohon right is the owner and then Idohon also there are a couple of groups I see and then I don't know that contributor. Is that for audio folks?

Participant_D   9:15
So.
Yeah, these are PIM PIM manage groups.

Participant_C   9:31
The contributor role.

Participant_D   9:32
Yeah, these are O managed groups, yeah.

Participant_P   9:32
That's an interesting question. I don't know.

Participant_E   9:33
But it was. It was initially set up for us, but contributor didn't have access to manage apps like enterprise apps and created apps. So we we had to roll it up to.

Participant_C   9:37
Mm-hmm.

Participant_E   9:51
Owner.
Both of them were for us, but the idea behind it, once everything is set up and moved to dev and no one necessarily will have access beyond contributor and contributors, there's gonna be only couple people like Participant_P and myself for example.

Participant_C   9:53
Hmm.

Participant_D   9:54
Oh.
Hello, can you hear me?

Participant_P   14:11
Them. Participant_J specifically manages them.
Them.

Participant_D   14:14
OK.
OK.
Go ahead, darling.

Participant_C   14:18
No, I'm just tagging along with the question you asked about personas, right. And I I I don't know if I heard it correctly, you know, so generally, right, what happens at customers is you know from the personal perspective, right, there are people who just manage the workspace.
There are people who just manage lakehouse notebooks and then there are people who just work with the data pipelines and then there will be, you know, people like who work just with the Power BI artifacts.
So do you, do you have that kind of team structure? I think I'm just trying to expand what Participant_D was asking or it's like a one in all, like everyone has multiple hats.

Participant_P   15:01
Yeah.
So currently we, yeah, it's a small team of three. We all wear different, all of the same different possible hats out there for data professionals. Whether that changes in the future, that's probably a question for Participant_G, but as of right now.
Everything does a little bit of everything. Data engineering, data science and Power BI reports.

Participant_C   15:33
OK, OK. Because see what happens, right? We have to bucket this a little bit differently. You know, again, it will be part of our recommendation where you know we will have some tenant level access, right, which can control.
You know access across the, you know CloudProviderA Fabric side of it and then you know there could be a role maybe like you know more than one person obviously capacity level control. Then there should be a control on the workspace level and then we can drill down to item level permissions such as lake house.
Notebooks, so on and so forth. That's what you know, our thought process, our recommendations are. But again, like you know, that's the reason I wanted to understand the personas and I think you guys answered that. Thank you.

Participant_P   16:21
Yeah, I think as of right now we're all Power BI admins, so I don't know if that helps, but.

Participant_C   16:28
So Power BI admins that you are just working or your goal is to just create a Power BI analytics and whatnot towards the end of the day. But the development of actually the pipelines, creating the pipelines, working with the data, ingestion of data pipelines and all that will not be.
Done by you guys or it will be done by your vendor ModelQ?

Participant_P   16:53
No, we're in charge of everything. They'll be developing an ML model and that's that's it. But.

Participant_C   17:00
OK, so so they will be developing the model. You will be responsible for creating the data pipelines. You are responsible for, you know, making sure that net notebooks and its version controls are part of your duties. Anything related with the lake house is part of your, you know, duties. Is that what I'm?
I'm I'm understanding.

Participant_P   17:20
Correct. Yeah. And then we'll also build our own ML model. So literally, we're gonna be doing everything.

Participant_C   17:21
OK, gotcha.
OK, sounds great. Three people. OK, thank you.

Participant_D   17:28
Yeah.

Participant_P   17:29
Yeah.

Participant_D   17:31
And then like so for for like today, so Ali mentioned like a partner, right when they come in, you know, very similar to us, right?
Who does that account creation or the invites? Is it? Is it be instantiated from you guys or is it instantiated from like like Participant_M and them?

Participant_P   17:59
So when we hire a vendor, we usually just go and talk to Participant_J that they need access and he's the one who's been helping us with that.

Participant_D   18:09
OK. And then today, um, they're just manual invites, right? Um, they're not using any like governance?
Like governance to a link. OK, I'll ask him. Perfect.

Participant_P   18:19
That I don't know.

Participant_D   18:26
And then I'm assuming the same process will be for like like vendors like ModelQ. So you're going to trust that you know you have the security folks who invite them, they're going to grant access they have now they have access to into the environment and then specific authorizations they'll have to pin up.
But it's still delegated through security folks, right? Not you guys.

Participant_P   18:50
Yep, right.

Participant_D   18:51
Okay, perfect. Okay. All right.
And then OK, all right. Um.
And then, um, I guess the other questions is.
He did mention, you know, all the resources are going through an policy. I think Participant_J mentioned that. So you know that that's a good thing. I'm assuming that you know the.
Sign in logs are going to a Log Analytics workspace also. Do you know?
Is it? Does that sound familiar or if not, it's it?

Participant_P   19:32
No, I do.
I've yeah, you should ask him. I mean, I've heard of logs. They they have some security logs. I don't know which ones specifically.

Participant_D   19:37
I could ask Participant_J.
Yeah.
So.
And the VM itself, like the Hive Q, does this have connectivity to the on premise environment today?
It does via like a site to site VPN direct express route link.
You know.

Participant_P   20:21
I think it's under a VPN. I might know a little bit more, but goes through the firewall as well. I know we've had to set up some firewall rules to allow the traffic to go back and forth.
And the on Prem as well as on the side and but yeah it's basically a VM or this VM communicating to another VM on Prem.

Participant_D   20:44
Mhm.
OK, so and the firewalls, are those also managed by the ACME folks?

Participant_P   21:03
I believe the on Prem ones are managed by Idahun and the cloud one is by ACME.
Just based on who I have to reach out.

Participant_D   21:16
Yeah. OK. All right, cool. And this, this is where all the networking folks come in, right? They're going to, you know, they they kind of they're doing the design. I mean, right, right now it sounds like a very traditional design, basically connectivity from the on-premises environment.
Traverses, you know, you know the site to site VPN which then you know you probably have you know those firewalls which is establishing that right. It's not a direct circuit which then you spin up the V Nets which have those VMS and then you know.
The routing log is connected.
OK, so I'm oversimplifying it too. Alright, perfect. Now give me one second.
OK. Before I go into the on the on premise environment there is we could, we could just pivot really quick to the fabric configuration, the fabric setup. So you have your fabric capacity here the fabric tenant is.
Is is connected to the Acme-Sub environment and subscription right? Is your guys fabric instance?

Participant_P   22:33
Yes.

Participant_D   22:34
OK, how are um?
Now we have specific roles there or administrative roles. How do you manage the the tenant level administration administrative roles there?

Participant_P   22:48
The fabric.

Participant_D   22:50
Yeah.

Participant_P   22:52
So we have a intro ID group where all three of us, the IT team and a couple of folks from the ACME analytics team are also there and we all have.

Participant_D   23:07
OK.

Participant_P   23:09
Admin.
Level.

Participant_D   23:14
OK. And then that's good. What about at the workspace level, you know, you know, do you do you manage, you manage the authorization there too probably using the same pattern?

Participant_P   23:32
Yeah, yeah. So and usually nobody else for the majority of the part of in the workspaces, almost nobody else other than us have access to the Power BI workspaces.

Participant_D   23:34
OK.

Participant_P   23:48
What we give people access is to the apps, Power BI apps, and that's usually it. Nobody else usually goes into a Power BI workspace other than us.

Participant_D   24:02
Yep.
OK. Um.
The users OK, so thinking, you know, like big picture, right? Beyond just the, you know, kind of this use case, right?
Do you know well before I get in there? OK, the user access to these various Power BI apps? Like who would who would those users be? External users? Internal users? Like like who would be that? Who would be those folks?

Participant_P   24:36
Internal.

Participant_D   24:37
Internal.
Time.
Internal to um Acme-Sub, right?

Participant_P   24:44
Yep.

Participant_D   24:46
Um. If ACME folks need access, they'll just go through like um.
Like a a cross tenant sink or have you thought about that?

Participant_P   24:57
Andre, have we ever done that before? I mean, I know you were working with Participant_G to give what was his name, a VP of ACME access to our Power BI reports. Did that ever?
Happen or?
Other than that scenario, I can't remember a scenario where an ACME employee would access our Power BI reports.

Participant_E   25:29
Participant_G, please go ahead.

Participant_G   25:29
Yeah, I don't know that that happened. I can't remember.

Participant_E   25:32
I can't remember specifically about that one, but I know we we we do go into each other's tenants through guests well.

Participant_G   25:35
Me neither.

Participant_D   25:43
Do you guys accounts?

Participant_E   25:45
Yeah, I I do know I can use the like the Power BI link with ACME tenant at the end of it and go see some stuff in their tenants and I assume they can do the same. We just don't do that.
Often enough for me to remember. Sorry.

Participant_D   26:01
Yeah, OK. Andrea and and and Participant_P, do you guys have like, you know, given that ACME is your parent company, do you guys, you you guys don't have ACME identities, right? I'm assuming that you guys have.
You do access their resources if you have to do the do a guest account, right?

Participant_P   26:27
I would assume it's.

Participant_D   26:28
Where where I'm getting at is is is it you know I mean the pattern it's gonna be assumption that the pattern is there that if if they need if they do need to collaborate you know or grant access in the future for somebody in in like let's let's say an ACME VP to the RBI report then you know you could.
Definitely leverage the the um cross the the right. So that's that would be the which you know we can you know we have specific recommendation on the on that.
Versus creating secondary accounts.

Participant_E   27:03
Yeah, yeah, that's that's very good assumption. I know that at some point there was a thought of having dual accounts for everyone everywhere, but I think that died out maybe four years ago, something like that.

Participant_D   27:19
Yeah, yeah, 'cause what happens now, you have to manage them, right? So you know, that would be a burden on whomever, whether that's Participant_J or Participant_M them, right? Versus you just manage the authorization, right? So you know, one account.

Participant_E   27:29
Mhm.

Participant_D   27:35
You manage the authorization, it's a lot easier, right? Versus 2 accounts, right? So OK, perfect. And you know, this is, this is really good. OK, user access.
Authorization. Same pattern for authorization workspaces. Um.
Second.
Ask.
OK, so Liam, if you think, if you think of anything that does come up, feel free to chime in because I will kind of go back down like I'm right now I'm my measure is just cover the cloud.

Participant_G   28:25
Yeah.

Participant_C   28:30
OK.

Participant_D   28:30
And then, you know, we get to the edge and then, you know, kind of going down to the, you know, down to back on premise, right? Um. So feel free to jump in if I miss something. Um.

Participant_C   28:33
Yep.
Right. Yep. No, I I do have a question. Thanks Participant_D for for that. Right. So just wondering Participant_G, maybe this is for you. Is Acme-Sub or ACME right? Are they using CloudProviderA Defender for Cloud?

Participant_P   28:59
Yeah.

Participant_C   29:00
OK, perfect. So that's inherited I assume from the tenant through a policy, policy that is. OK, great. OK, perfect. We'll verify that like you know once we have access. The other question like I have is right, I see you know.

Participant_G   29:07
Yep.
Yeah, I would assume so.

Participant_C   29:18
You know the resources that we normally see. However, I do not see any key vault here. So where are you going to put your keys or credentials, you know, password or pass phrases or certificates and whatnot when when you need?
What is? What is? What is it you guys are planning for?

Participant_G   29:39
We do typically use Key Vault, so I'm not sure why you can't see that.

Participant_C   29:41
OK.
Yeah, I don't see that.

Participant_D   29:45
It might be in a separate subscription or something. Where do you guys like? Is it used in the automation?

Participant_G   29:48
Yeah.

Participant_C   29:48
OK.

Participant_D   29:54
Participant_G or?

Participant_G   29:55
Yeah.

Participant_D   29:57
'Cause I I know we mentioned that like automation is kind of basic, right? You know, like today, you know, if you do have to do things manually, right?

Participant_G   29:58
Yeah.

Participant_D   30:08
You know, there to to Participant_C's point, you know, typically we'll have a vault, right? But then there's a rotation policy, right? Do you guys do that for the secrets? It's really kind of going to secrets management.

Participant_G   30:23
Do do what? Sorry.

Participant_D   30:27
Like rotate the secrets.

Participant_G   30:29
Rotate them. Boy, I'm not sure about that. I don't. I haven't heard them doing about them doing that, but it's quite possible.

Participant_D   30:30
Thank.
OK, OK, um.
No worries. Um...

Participant_C   30:41
Yeah, I I would keep a separate key vault, you know, because you don't want others to rotate the key for you, you know, because you you guys are three, yeah.

Participant_G   30:49
Yeah, it's a good question for like Participant_Q. He's involved with that pretty extensively.

Participant_D   30:53
OK.

Participant_C   30:55
OK. OK. Yeah, we can. We can definitely bring this again. Thank you.

Participant_D   30:56
Yep.
Yep. And then, um, so Participant_C kinda touched the point that, you know, I may have over overlooked. Um. So you mentioned Defender, right? Um.
Which Defender components are you using?
Like Defender for Cloud.

Participant_G   31:20
Yes.

Participant_D   31:21
OK, so that's that's more of the resource posture management. What about in your Entre tenant? Do you have identities that do you have a like do you do you guys authenticate to a local Active Directory environment that syncs an identity up?

Participant_G   31:40
I believe the answer to that is yes, but I'm not the person to ask and there's got to be.

Participant_D   31:47
Is that it?

Participant_G   31:47
Admins. If we don't have any admins on the call, that'd be the best approach to get that.

Participant_D   31:50
OK. Is that environment? Oh, sorry.

Participant_F   31:52
Are are you, are you talking about for the Acme-Sub tenant or the ACME tenant?

Participant_D   31:56
Yes, yeah, yeah, the Acme-Sub.

Participant_F   32:00
Is uh, I don't suppose Participant_J is on a call, is he?

Participant_D   32:05
No, I don't see them.

Participant_F   32:05
Oh, it doesn't look like it.

Participant_G   32:06
I don't see him.

Participant_R   32:08
No, he jumped off at the start when we we started. I'll I'll I'll ping him here.

Participant_G   32:10
Good questions.

Participant_F   32:10
M.
My, my, yeah.

Participant_D   32:15
But this is fine. So you guys do have an Active Directory environment. Is the security of that governed by Participant_J's team also like ACME ACME folks?

Participant_F   32:29
So yes, so both Acme-Sub and ACME have their own on Prem Active Directory that then sync up to their own Entre tenants and the the the security posture both of those eventually rolls up through.

Participant_G   32:30
Or is?

Participant_D   32:41
Yep.

Participant_F   32:47
ACME's security policies, I believe, if that makes sense. I don't know if that's what you're asking or not.

Participant_D   32:50
OK, OK, great. Great. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's kind of what I'm asking because you know, you know, one of the, you know, you know, areas to consider is, you know, whether a threat actor.
You know, can all the pathways an an actor, a bad actor can potentially exploit, right? And often it it could happen from the on premise environment. So you know, given that ACME is is managing in that, it's a good thing. There's a whole set of questions, right? Like.
You know, do they have their, do they have their security tools, which I'm gonna assume that they do cause this will be more of a a Participant_J Participant_M conversation. Are they using like Defender for Identity to to kind of get signals, you know?
Into their environment so they can see it and then they troubleshoot. You know, you know it's it's just making sure that all the pathways, all the pathways like for the overall solution have you know there's no blind spots is where where I'm getting at.

Participant_F   33:53
Um.

Participant_D   33:53
OK. OK. So good question.
And then, you know, we don't have to pull Participant_J in right now, cause when I do draw this in a diagram, this is what I'm gonna review with him, right? So you know, I'm sure that he'll be able to color more in there. Perfect. There is a PowerShell module.

Participant_F   34:07
OK.

Participant_D   34:14
That we use to extract the fabric tenant level settings, right? It's often, you know, kind of exercise we want to do, you know, just to, you know, go through the specific settings and.
And you know, make sure that, you know, you guys have thought about it. There's a specific use case to enable or disable specific things, right. It's just an exercise we do, you would do, you know, in terms of due diligence just to make sure, OK, like we don't ever see.
This, this like, you know, we don't ever see this use case being there. You know, you know this, this, this tenant setting can be turned off, right? Are you guys, have you guys played with the Fabric PowerShell modules?
This would be probably the the the Fabric PowerShell modules.

Participant_P   35:11
The fabric. What? Sorry.
No, uh, I've done some.

Participant_D   35:18
OK.

Participant_P   35:21
Power BI APIs back in the day, but no.

Participant_D   35:27
OK, give me one second. Yeah, 'cause what I could do is.
You know I need to review these again 'cause I used these at another customer, but.
These are these these are the Fabric Power B PowerShell modules, which from an automation perspective, if you do integrate things into your CICD pipelines or you want to do things administrative. Oh no, I put it in the chat. I put it in the chat, yeah.

Participant_G   35:53
Are you displaying something? Sorry, Participant_D. Oh, Chad. OK, thanks.

Participant_D   36:00
I put in the chat, you know these are modules that you can use to, you know, to do things like you know, execute CRUD operations against your workspace if you don't, if you don't, if you don't want to do it via direct APIs, right?
So you know this PowerShell module does allow us to pull out information also, right? So you know, one second, I'll I'll share my screen. I just gotta make sure that.
Isn't anything confidential in this?
So as you can see, you know how we do it is you know we're we're able to import the module and then we'll we'll get get an authentication token and then from there we can invoke you know to extract all the tenant settings just to make sure we have you know versus going through it.
You know, in the UI, but this is kind of something that you'll want to see. Um, it will review as an exercise. Um.
You know, but like I said, more importantly, this Fabric PS PowerShell module is is is very useful for automation of, you know, management of the workspaces, et cetera, right?
So I put it in the chat. Um.
Press later on, right?
OK, now.
In regards to access to, in regards to access to the workspaces themselves, right, this is the future state, right? Access in, you know, access for any data purposes, data science, you know, whatever they whatever they need.
You know this the the users will only be ACME or Acme-Sub, right? There's no external users that are gonna like get access to the workspace itself.
Is that a fair assumption?

Participant_P   38:15
Yes, I would say so.

Participant_D   38:17
OK. And then anybody else gets direct access into the like just Power BI apps itself, right? Reports.

Participant_P   38:25
Yep.

Participant_D   38:25
OK, perfect. All right. Um, OK, second.
But.
My picture.
OK, so.
Share my screen really quick.
Alright, now kind of going back to the edge, right? Um.
Oh.
Yeah, you see my screen.

Participant_P   39:16
Yes.

Participant_D   39:31
Trying to make it.
Um, OK.
Thinking here this is, you know, right here is where the VPN exists, right?
VPN So this Kubernetes cluster, this Kubernet, the the Kubernetes cluster. Did we see this resource? These are the VMS right themselves.

Participant_P   40:04
Yes, so.

Participant_D   40:05
OK.

Participant_P   40:07
So we have the option to either have it be a Kubernetes cluster or just a VM.

Participant_D   40:13
OK.

Participant_F   40:15
I think the the long term goal in the cloud Participant_P was to make that a an actual AKS private cluster.

Participant_D   40:15
End it.

Participant_P   40:23
Mm-hmm. Yep.

Participant_D   40:24
OK, that's what I was thinking to.

Participant_P   40:25
You're correct.

Participant_F   40:25
Which we we started working on that and kind of ran into some Rd. bumps and just to get things up and running to not delay the entire project. That's when they put the MQTT broker on just a Is it a Windows VM or is it just some other standalone VM?

Participant_P   40:43
Yeah, it's just a Windows VM.

Participant_F   40:45
OK.

Participant_D   40:47
OK, perfect. Now the connectivity to the on premise environment is this, this ACME, is the ACME network or is the Acme-Sub like this IT network DMC?

Participant_F   41:00
Um, so that is, are you talking about from the cloud to on Prem?
Or just on Prem. So yeah, so from the cloud that the MQTT broker and then the rest of those resources are in their own Vnet that has Vnet peering to a.

Participant_D   41:07
Yes, yes, yeah, yeah, from from the cloud on Prem.

Participant_F   41:23
VWAN virtual hub in the ACME tenant where we then have a firewall for inspection and then also a VPN gateway back to on premise and so then that traffic goes to that VPN gateway.
To Acme-Subs on Prime Network.

Participant_D   41:40
OK, so you you.
OK, so you're actually traversing. So if I read that, if I hear that correctly, you're traversing the ACME cloud to get back onto the on on premise environment, right?

Participant_F   41:49
OK.
Yes, that is correct. And I hope that's gonna be temporary because ideally assuming the tenants stay separate, ideally there's gonna be a a landing zone reference architecture with the hub and spoke model in the ACME tenant like there is today and then also one in the Acme-Sub tenant which.

Participant_D   41:53
OK, OK.
Yep.

Participant_F   42:12
Isn't there yet.

Participant_D   42:12
OK.
OK, perfect. Now in terms of, oh, sorry, go ahead, go.

Participant_F   42:15
So.
I was, I was just gonna say, so the the, like I said, the resources are in Acme-Subs tenant, but just to get network connectivity up and running, we just peered that Vnet across tenants to the Acme-Sub or to the ACME tenant and so that's how we have network connectivity today.

Participant_D   42:34
Yep.
And then in terms of the message, like the message queues, right, how do you, how are the, you know, the messages from the client to the the, the to the broker, those are all secured right using TLS 120 or 3.0?
No.
1.3 sorry.
Do we know?

Participant_P   43:01
Has the capability, but right now it's not secured.

Participant_D   43:05
Oh, it's not secured.
And then in terms of what are the like, how do the the clients communicate or authenticate to the to brokers? Are they using username, TLS or Oauth or?

Participant_P   43:24
You have the option for all three. As of right now, nothing has been said.

Participant_D   43:30
OK.
Quick question. Is that a concern? You know, typically you know we want to add layers of security related there. Just curious why?

Participant_P   43:46
It's still under development, so.

Participant_D   43:48
OK.
OK.
All right. And I'm sure like the security folks are are aware of this. I mean, it is something that I just call out, right? These are some of the recommendations to secure this type of, you know, communications, right from the on-premises environment.
You know, and then there's just what this within the deliverables, this just becomes like either recommendation as an item in the backlog to be remediated or you know, you know, it becomes a discussion point that we talk about.
On you know what are the pros and cons really it's it's you know from a security perspective we look at like locking down everything all the way through, right, you know, but at the same time as the bid from the business standpoint, you know.
Is this susceptible to eavesdropping? You know the type of information you know, you know should be protected, et cetera, right?
Alim, do you got anything else that you wanted to talk about? Oh yeah, on this one. OK, so really quick from the cloud, there's the integrations to like external services, right? CloudDB_A, CloudProviderB.
Um.
How are like are these credentials being thrown into the the key vault right now or?
Like how do how does this integration work?

Participant_P   45:30
So I don't know exactly how the iPads communicate to VendorR that I don't know. I know we've been pulling from CloudDB_A, which is what VendorR uses for their.

Participant_D   45:31
The APIs.
OK.

Participant_P   45:46
Data warehouse platform and they provide a username and a password.

Participant_D   45:52
OK, who who provides username, password?

Participant_P   45:55
That's so. Hey, man. Yeah, yeah.

Participant_D   45:56
Oh, red zone.
What are these iPads used for?

Participant_P   46:02
It's just to enter QA checks and those type of things operators do on.
X amount of time basis.

Participant_D   46:19
OK.
And then this is is API. Um, hey, we talked about that.
OK, this is making sense now. Um.
At what point does information like leave the I you know? At what point does data get sent to ModelQ? The this service? There's no arrow right now. Will it be coming from?
You know on premise or will it be coming straight from the Acme-Sub and tenant? Remember I'm the security guy, not the data guy, so just setting the expectation right?

Participant_P   47:03
Yeah, no, no worries. They have access to our historian and that's how they have been pulling our data, so.

Participant_C   47:07
Well.

Participant_D   47:10
OK.
OK, they pull it OK.

Participant_P   47:15
Yeah, they have.

Participant_C   47:15
But but when they pull it right, are they pulling into a CSV and then they are massaging the data, doing any data transformation there and then creating a curated CSV file and then that file is now made available into, you know, maybe storage account of sort?
But I'm like I just want to know if you have high level.

Participant_P   47:36
Yeah, no, that's that's mostly true. They extract the data from the historian, I'm assuming in the CSV file, then putting it in their CloudProviderB environment.

Participant_C   47:45
Mhm.
So what? What is the dependency on CloudProviderB, right? That's where I am kind of disconnected because I thought right, the model will be developed right in CloudProviderB. That was my understanding it. And then once the model is developed, they will provide you the model and you know all the artifacts and then you are going to implement.

Participant_D   47:53
And then?

Participant_C   48:13
That you know on Prem in a you know like an local or at your edge and then somehow the data is fed through your systems on Prem itself. So I'm not understanding the fact about CloudProviderB there.

Participant_P   48:29
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I know it's it's confusing, but basically ModelQ has their own fabric, their own analytical platform and so.
That's where they are hosting it in CloudProviderB.

Participant_D   48:45
OK, so so when they when they use the term CloudProviderB, it's just their hosting platform. So conceptually if if I'm thinking about this, the ETL process is going to to a ModelQ service, it just happens to be on a WS. Is that is that accurate?

Participant_P   49:00
Yeah, yeah. And they're using the 88 DLS version of CloudProviderB and they have some Kubernetes cluster that runs their Python scripts and trains the models and stuff like that, so.

Participant_D   49:06
OK.
OK, so so that like the CloudProviderB could be classified, OK, like ModelQ tenant or ModelQ service, right? So OK, now once the data, once they do what they need to do, how do you get, are they going to push the data back or do you have to go get?

Participant_P   49:22
Mhm.

Participant_D   49:32
Edit or like how you know how does that?

Participant_P   49:36
So right now the plan is that they will.

Participant_D   49:37
You know.

Participant_P   49:41
Create the model and then put it on on Prem so no data will be coming out from our on Prem to their CloudProviderB tenant once the model has been.
Trained.

Participant_C   49:56
So yeah, that's exactly was the confusion. You see what I thought was or what I remember hearing in the past that they will do all the develop development work, you know, in CloudProviderB and once the work is done, the whole thing is exported and you know, put on the Acme-Sub edge. That's what my understanding was. Now if that's the.
The answer fine, right? And maybe they will expose, you know, some sort of API endpoint for some proprietary stuff. I don't know that. But again, if you lose connectivity from Edge to CloudProviderB then we have a problem here, right? So that's why I think you are running the model.
But The thing is, how are you going to feed the data on a regular basis for your use case, right? What is that mechanism? How are they going to ingest the data and where are they going to ingest the data? Is it still the same MQTT as your publisher and how it is getting the data there? Those are the things.
That I'm a little bit lost, honestly.

Participant_P   50:59
Post training or pre training?

Participant_C   51:01
Post training, right? So forget about training. See The thing is training is done once unless you have changes and then validation again. But post training right when you are in production, how are you feeding?
The data to to your model, the constant like you know.

Participant_P   51:20
Hello.
Yeah, it'll be through the MQTT broker where the UNS or unified namespace will be hosted.

Participant_C   51:31
And where will that be?

Participant_P   51:32
That's gonna be on Prem on the you see the Hive MQ little circle under the IT network. Yeah, that's where it's gonna be.

Participant_C   51:34
Edge OK.

Participant_D   51:39
Mm-hmm. Yeah, right here.

Participant_C   51:39
Mhm.
OK. OK. Gotcha. OK, perfect. Thank you.

Participant_D   51:48
So, so from from once they create the model, they'll they'll place is did I hear that correct? They place it back, they will, they will push it back here into this broker which then.
You have the data, you have the model back right at that point.

Participant_P   52:05
Scroll a little bit downwards on your diagram. I wonder if Tyler added this to.
Here but it.
Doesn't look like, but yeah, it'll be basically another little circle which will be either a Kubernetes cluster or a VM to be determined that will that will, you know, host that ML model.

Participant_D   52:20
OK.
OK.

Participant_P   52:35
As a container. And so from there you have several options, right? You can have an API right that receives the inputs and then spits out the outputs. Or you can have that same container reach out directly to the MQTT broker and pull in the inputs right and then communicate back.

Participant_D   52:37
Alright.
Mhm.

Participant_P   52:55
To the broker.

Participant_D   52:56
OK.

Participant_P   52:57
Those are the two options that we have right now. Our ModelQ team is on the like the first stages of developing the ML model. That's not something we have.
Defined fully, but.
That's where what? That's what we're heading towards.

Participant_D   53:19
OK, perfect. I know we're at time. Believe it or not, I've I've been able to capture everything I needed to develop the diagrams, reference architectures or the diagrams so I can start evaluating the security.
To have a more productive conversation in the next meeting, which you know, as I mentioned, you know what I do is I I format, I format it into something like this, right, which then is going to have specific security call outs.

Participant_C   53:46
Yeah.

Participant_D   53:53
And then a lot of it is, you know, what I'll do is I'll send a draft to Participant_M and Participant_J copying the whole team for them to review. And then what we do is from there is, you know, just we'll get on a call probably to verify the configuration. The goal of it is really to identify any blind spots.
And or make recommendations or you know, you know from a security perspective, um.
You know that that's kind of where we're at. Participant_C, do you have anything else that you wanted to talk about? Like I said, I've I've got what I needed for now.

Participant_C   54:25
No, I right, so perfect, right. So the only thing is right, I still I'm hoping that we have access to like to take a look at few things. That's the only thing. And then our next topic is like logging and monitoring.

Participant_D   54:41
Yep.

Participant_C   54:42
You know, whenever we are, you know, we'll do schedule based on, you know, everyone's schedule, right. So I think we are heading in the right direction. I think that's all we have for now.

Participant_D   54:52
OK, Participant_G. Sorry, I didn't. I was gonna mention to call you out on that one. Did you did you catch that? Cause I think Participant_R left.

Participant_G   55:01
I'm sorry, catch what?

Participant_D   55:03
Oh, our last statement. I I kind of summarized where we were at. Sorry, I forgot to call you out on that one, so.

Participant_G   55:09
Yeah.

Participant_D   55:13
Yeah, basically what I said was, you know, you know, we're at our, we're at the top of the hour. We we, you know, I've, believe it or not, I've been able to capture everything I needed to have a productive conversation with the security folks, right. Next steps is, you know, I basically take all my notes, all my napkin notes.

Participant_G   55:17
Right.
Mhm.

Participant_D   55:32
And I convert it into a formalized reference architecture, which then I'll, you know, it'll have specific, you know, recommendations or validations that I'll send to the ACME Security folks right ahead of time for review. From there, you know they'll have feedback, but you know we'll get on a call to review that right.
With them in the in the next call and I think you know Ali mentioned that you know we're heading in the right right direction you know in terms of you know getting the information we need but that those you know that's kind of a summary of you know what we did today and next steps.

Participant_G   56:10
Yep, perfect.

Participant_C   56:11
Yeah, and forward Participant_G, one one thing I request, you know, with open heart and open arms, do provide us the feedback, you know, right away if you need, if you need to change gates or if you need to see any specific topics if we are, you know, taking you guys on a ride because see once we understand.

Participant_D   56:12
Alright.

Participant_C   56:31
And then your environment, right, then you know we will come back with the the right recommendations and best practices what CloudProviderA recommends to other customers based on your use case. So early feedback, yeah.

Participant_G   56:38
Right. Yep. No, that's that's accurate. I think my only feedback is that I think there were points where we didn't have the right folks in the room when it comes to some of the when it came to some of the questions just because we had.

Participant_C   56:53
Yeah.

Participant_G   56:54
A lot of developers in the room, but maybe not a lot of infrastructure and security folks on hand or the right ones.

Participant_C   56:59
Yep. No what we will do. No, no, you are, you are spot on on that, right. So what we can do, we can formalize, you know another e-mail with you know, call to action on specific topics like networking or identity. In this way we can pull the right people. So these notes will definitely help us.

Participant_D   57:01
Yep.

Participant_G   57:17
Yeah, perfect.

Participant_C   57:17
So Yep, Yep. Awesome. Alright, great. Thanks so much everyone. Have a wonderful rest of the day. We'll talk to you guys soon.

Participant_G   57:20
Yep, I think so.

Participant_D   57:26
Yeah.
Uh, Participant_B, do you have anything you want? Um, otherwise we'll.

Participant_B   57:31
No, no, thank you. We'll we'll catch up. But yeah, thanks guys.

Participant_D   57:32
close out.

Participant_G   57:36
Yep. Thanks, Participant_D. Thanks, Participant_C.

Participant_P   57:37
Thanks everyone.

Participant_C   57:38
Take care. Thank you. Bye.

Participant_G   57:40
Bye, bye.

Participant_E   57:40
Yeah, bye.
