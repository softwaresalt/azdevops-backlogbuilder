## Overview

The Product Backlog Accelerator is a project that demonstrates how to leverage **GitHub Copilot** and AI-powered development practices to synthesize various project artifacts into well-structured Agile features, user stories, and even tasks. This project focuses on the ACME Predictive Maintenance project, but the methodology can be applied to any software development initiative.
