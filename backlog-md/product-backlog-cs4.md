# ACME Predictive Maintenance Project - Product Backlog

## Project Overview
This product backlog defines the implementation roadmap for the ACME Predictive Maintenance project, focusing on a hybrid on-premises and cloud architecture that maintains operational resilience during internet outages while enabling advanced analytics and machine learning capabilities.

**Key Architectural Principle**: On-premises model execution must remain operational independently of cloud connectivity.

**Updated Direction**: HiveMQ will send messages directly to Event Hub without requiring a cloud MQTT broker instance.
